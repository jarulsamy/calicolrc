Problems, issues, features, and questions.

Debugging:
MONO_LOG_LEVEL=debug calico --no-handler 

May need:

 <startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true">

in calico.exe.config to allow different frameworks (2 vs 4).

NOTE:

mono --runtime=v4.0 Calico.exe
mcs -sdk:2 File.cs ...

= Math.NET =

mathdotnet.com - numerics, symbolic, etc.

= Sdl =

6.1.0

1) Could not make .config find libSDL.dll
2) copied Calico/lib/SDL.dll to Calico/bin/libSDL.dll.so

Works with just Tao

= Ideas = 

1) SpeechBubble((center), "text", (endpoint))

2) Given a Text() object, need to know height, width:
>>> text.width("w")
16
>>> text.width("i")
8

# Examples
# Scheme doesn't raise exception in file load

These are issues with the code in Calico/src/*.py

# BUG: right-click on an error line 2nd time on windows doesn't load file (fixed with print? Probably a timing/lock issue)
# BUG: try to save to a read-only/link crashes
# BUG: UP and DOWN in history needs to move caret (on windows?)
# BUG: On close, need to wait for the connection to finish

Major missing features:

# Calico: Need to run code in an AppDomain rather than thread?
# Calico: Add Printing
# Calico: options for toggle word wrap, linenumbers, others
# Calico: connect menu edit/copy/paste/select all (see gtk-sharp for hints)
# Calico: No backups made of files when saving
# Calico: No backups made during editing (autosave)
# Calico: Quit doesn't ask if you are sure, or if you want to save unsaved edits.
# Calico: Plugins (see the way that gedit handles plugins)
# Calico: Need project icon/graphics
# Calico: glib.io_add_watch - watch to see if something else edits file?
# Calico: Find Libraries for text-to-speech, gamepad, 3D graphics, music, etc

= Education =

# Provide easy method to take surveys, quiz
# Log file for teacher analysis
# Provide student "Hint" links to wiki page on error
# Interactive instruction ala Classroom Presenter, but via chat
# Submit zipfile to teacher dialog (zipfiles written in src/utils.py)

= Modules =

These are issue in Calico/modules/*

Myro module for using robots:

Graphics module for easy 2D graphics:

# Graphics: make sure to do update for all interactive object changes
# Graphics: multi-point line using cairo
# Add buttons and sliders (ala NetLogo)

= Languages = 

IronPython on Mono:

# Unhandled Exception in recursion too deep is really handled, but crashes Mono

Experimental CLR Scheme:

# Scheme: (robot.beep 1.0 400.0 400.0) needs to be floats?
# Scheme: doesn't raise exception on loading file

Drag and drop language Dinah:

# Dinah: Get working
## Mono doesn't allow drag and drop from TreeView
## read classes, methods, params and return values from DLL
## save/read file format
## execute file

= System = 

DLR things for the Dynamic Language Runtime. Mono is the open source VM for the CLR.

# DLR: Stack overflow in Mono IronPython crashes rather than reports error.
# DLR: Can we run chiron and have our code run in web browser through Silverlight/Moonlight?

# Mono: Dinah crashes on Mac on drop. 
# Mono: Windows doesn't respond to treeview drags after Mono 2.6.4. Bug reported as: https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=664824
