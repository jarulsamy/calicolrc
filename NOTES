= Pyjama =

These are issues with the code in Pyjama/src/*.py

# IMMEDIATE:
# add fudge factors
# getObstacle() getBright() not working
# setData() fails
# add static functions for all of myro_test.py

# BUG: right-click on an error line 2nd time on windows doesn't load file (fixed with print? Probably a timing/lock issue)
# BUG: try to save to a read-only/link crashes
# BUG: UP and DOWN in history needs to move caret (on windows?)
# BUG: On close, need to wait for the connection to finish

# Pyjama: Need to run code in a process rather than thread?
# Pyjama: Add Printing
# Pyjama: options for toggle word wrap, linenumbers, others
# Pyjama: connect menu edit/copy/paste/select all (see gtk-sharp for hints)
# Pyjama: No backups made of files when saving
# Pyjama: No backups made during editing (autosave)
# Pyjama: Quit doesn't ask if you are sure, or if you want to save unsaved edits.
# Pyjama: Plugins (see the way that gedit handles plugins)
# Pyjama: Need project icon/graphics
# Pyjama: glib.io_add_watch - watch to see if something else edits file?
# Pyjama: Find Libraries for text-to-speech, gamepad, 3D graphics, music, etc
# Pyjama: Python exception when Gtk is running just hangs; why? In other thread?

= Education =

# Provide easy method to take surveys, quiz
# Log file for teacher analysis
# Provide student "Hint" links to wiki page on error
# Interactive instruction ala Classroom Presenter, but via chat
# Submit zipfile to teacher dialog (zipfiles written in src/utils.py)

= Modules =

These are issue in Pyjama/modules/*

Myro module for using robots:

# Myro: Robot needs jpeg decompress
# Myro: Write do_together in C#

Graphics module for easy 2D graphics:

# Graphics: clicking in Graphics windows cause lockup
# Graphics: make sure to do graphics init for all objects
# Graphics: make sure to do update for all interactive object changes
# Graphics: Need move_to_top, move_to_bottom (for Shape objects in modules/Graphics/Graphics.cs)
# Graphics: Unify graphics move/rotate (use Cairo rotate/translate or adjust our own points)
# Graphics: alpha doesn't apply to Pictures yet
# Graphics: Missing shapes: Circle, Oval, Text (C#, modules/Graphics/Graphics.cs)
# Graphics: multi-point line using cairo
# Add buttons and sliders (ala NetLogo)

= Languages = 

Experimental CLR Scheme:

# Scheme: (robot.beep 1.0 400.0 400.0) needs to be floats?

Drag and drop language Dinah:

# Dinah: Get working
## read classes, methods, params and return values from DLL
## save/read file format
## execute file

= System = 

DLR things for the Dynamic Language Runtime. Mono is the open source VM for the CLR.

# DLR: Stack overflow in Mono IronPython crashes rather than reports error.
# DLR: Can we run chiron and have our code run in web browser through Silverlight/Moonlight?

# Mono: Dinah crashes on Mac on drop. 
# Mono: Windows doesn't respond to treeview drags after Mono 2.6.4. Bug reported as: https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=664824
