* ngram.py is acting weird (window size?)
* tone.jig adding a scrollbar to window that already has one?! crash
* If you save a file on close, it isn't added to recently used
* add calico to Jigsaw dictionary
* need to refactor SimPioneer
* SimScribbler does not have set_blob_yuv
* Can't have two simulations? 
* need to add Shape.z (start height, end height)
* Check to see if "bitmap" works with lines, from a program. (Didn't work in Knots.py)
* Scheme: move slider to left, should allow click on pause button
* Scheme turned off the pause button?
* properly handled? --lang=LANG, --chat, --verbose, --reset?
* Printing gives error: Cairo.Context: called from finalization thread, 
  programmer is missing a call to Dispose
* Running a file does not use print as function. Need to... what? 
  set Python compiler options?
* Tab completion [needs refinement]
* Chat stuff (register, login, blast, chat)
* Show old error Help button on error
* Detect that the file has changed outside of Calico
* Currently, the graphviz code doesn't parse node lines, so attributes
  about the shape of nodes is ignored. To fix, edit:
  modules/Graphics/Graphviz4Net.Core/Dot/AntlrParser/DotGrammar.g
  to add { AddNode(); } (see example like AddEdge).
# try to save to a read-only/link crashes
# On close, need to wait for the Chat connection to finish
  (glib.io_add_watch - watch to see if something else edits file?)
# SpeechBubble((center), "text", (endpoint))
# Calico: Need to run code in an AppDomain rather than thread?
# Calico: options for toggle word wrap, linenumbers, others
# Calico: No backups made of files when saving
# Calico: No backups made during editing (autosave)
# Calico: Plugins (see the way that gedit handles plugins)
# Provide easy method to take surveys, quiz
# Log file for teacher analysis
# Provide student "Hint" links to wiki page on error
# Interactive instruction ala Classroom Presenter, but via chat
# Submit zipfile to teacher dialog (zipfiles written in src/utils.py)
# Scheme: (robot.beep 1.0 400.0 400.0) needs to be floats?
# Scheme: doesn't raise exception on loading file
# Dinah: Get working
# DLR: Can we run chiron and have our code run in web browser through Silverlight/Moonlight?
# Mono: Windows doesn't respond to treeview drags after Mono 2.6.4. Bug reported as: https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=664824

= Debugging Hints =

MONO_LOG_LEVEL=debug mono --trace --profile=gui-thread-check --debug calico --debug --debug-handler

May need:

 <startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true">

in calico.exe.config to allow different frameworks (2 vs 4).

= Math.NET =

mathdotnet.com - numerics, symbolic, etc.

= Sdl =

6.1.0

1) Could not make .config find libSDL.dll
2) copied Calico/lib/SDL.dll to Calico/bin/libSDL.dll.so

Works with just Tao
