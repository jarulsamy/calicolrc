BUILDING rosjava.dll


download rosjava

./gradlew install
tests will fail, that'sok

cd rosjava_tutorial_pubsub

../gradlew installApp


Now create a monster jar file
cd rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/build/install/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/lib
mkdir tmp

cd tmp
for x in ../*.jar; do    
    jar -xvf $x
done

jar -cvf ros.jar .
mv ros.jar ..
cd ..


That's fine for Calico. For processing a few things need to be deleted
before creating the jar.

rm -rf org/apache/commons/lang/enum #processing gets confused
rm std_msgs/String.class #processing again, renamed to SString


Then ikvm the jar file:

mono bin/ikvmc.exe -target:library ros.jar
