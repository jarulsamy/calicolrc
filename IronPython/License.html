<li>Definitions</li>
</ol>
<p>The terms &quot;reproduce,&quot; &quot;reproduction,&quot; &quot;derivative works,&quot; and

to the software.</p>
<p>A &quot;contributor&quot; is any person that distributes its contribution under
this license.</p>
<p>&quot;Licensed patents&quot; are a contributor's patent claims that read
directly on its contribution.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Grant of Rights</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Copyright Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including
the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor
grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license
to reproduce its contribution, prepare derivative works of its
contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative works
that you create.</p>
<p>(B) Patent Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the
license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor
grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its

import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the software
or derivative works of the contribution in the software.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Conditions and Limitations</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) No Trademark License - This license does not grant you rights to
use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.</p>
<p>(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents
that you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from
such contributor to the software ends automatically.</p>
<p>(C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all
copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present
in the software.</p>
<p>(D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form,
you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of
this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of
the software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under
a license that complies with this license.</p>
<p>(E) The software is licensed &quot;as-is.&quot; You bear the risk of using it.
The contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions.
You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which
this license cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local
laws, the contributors exclude the implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
non-infringement.</p>
