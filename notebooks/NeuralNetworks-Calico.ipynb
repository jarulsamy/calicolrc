      "We will concentrate mostly on **backpropagation networks** here. A typical backprop network is a three layer network containing **input**, **hidden**, and **output** layers. Each layer contains a collection of nodes. Typically, the nodes in a layer are fully connected to the next layer. For instance, every input node will have a weighted connection to every hidden node. Similarly, every hidden node will have a `weighted connection` to every output node.\n",
      "\n",
      "Processing in a backprop network works as follows. Input is propagated forward from the input layer through the hidden layer and finally through the output layer to produce a response. Each node, regardless of the layer it is in, uses the same transfer function in order to propagate its information forward to the next layer. This is described next.\n",

      "Each node maintains an activation value that depends on the activation values of its incoming neighbors, the weights from its incoming neighbors, and its own default bias value. To compute this activation value, we first calculate the node's net input.\n",
