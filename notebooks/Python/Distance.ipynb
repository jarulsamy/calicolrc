      "However, sometimes that type of measurement isn't practical. For example, consider driving in New York City. Knowing that your destination is a distance of exactly 1.2 miles away \"as the crow flies\" (eg, direct distance) doesn't really give you a hint as to how long it will take you to get there. What you really need to know is the \"city block\" distance. This is the distance given that you have to drive on the grid, and can never take a diagonal, lest you drive through a building! It gets more complicated if one takes into account one-way streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, we can take these additional constraints and data into account, and come up with a different measurement (and units) of distance. For example, we could compute the amount of time it would take to take a taxi to our destination. This might include finding one, the city-block driving distance multiplied by average speed, etc. We could then compare taxi-time to subway time. This measurement of distance is much more useful for our purposes.\n",

      "A common goal in information science is to compute the distance between two abstract sequences of data. Just like in the NYC taxi example where we need to get from point A to point B, we need a way of measuring how to \"get\" from one datum to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's consider text, also known as strings. What is the distance between \"apple\" and \"aple\"? Why would you want to know? The distance between strings could be useful for many purposes. For example, if you wrote \"aple\" a computer program (say a word processor or a cell phone app) might want to compute possible alternate real words for using in a spelling checking function, or an \"auto correct\" feature (see [1] for funny auto-correct nightmares).\n",
      "\n",
      "Sequences, such as strings, appear throughout many aspects of life. And knowing the differences between any two can be a very useful measurement. Take, for instance, a string composed of of the letters A, T, G, and C. This is, of course, the parts that make up strings of DNA. Being able to compute, and thus measure, the differences between two species' DNA provides us with interesting information about these two species. \n",
      "\n",
      "How could we compute a difference between two sequence? One method would be to count up the changes that it takes in order to turn one string into the other. For example, one can turn \"cat\" into \"caps\" by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. change the \"t\" into a \"p\" (+1 for an edit)\n",
      "1. add an \"s\" onto the end (+1 for an insert)\n",
      "\n",
      "This gives a distance of 2. Of course, this is not the only \"path\" to change \"cat\" into \"caps\". Here is another:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. delete the \"t\" (+1 for an delete)\n",
      "1. add an \"p\" onto the end (+1 for an insert)\n",
      "1. add an \"s\" onto the end (+1 for an insert)\n",
      "\n",
      "This gives a distance of 3. Of course, we are interested in the minimum distance, so we consider 2 to be the correct answer in this case. \n",
      "\n",
      "By finding the minimum of the sum of the total edits, deletions, and insertions, we can get a measure of the difference between two strings. \n",
