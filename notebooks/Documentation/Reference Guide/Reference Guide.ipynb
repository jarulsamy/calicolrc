      "Why is Markdown better? Well, it\u2019s worth saying that maybe it isn't. Mainly, it\u2019s not actually a question of better or worse, but of what\u2019s in front of you and of who you are. A definitive answer depends on the user and on that user\u2019s goals and experience. These Notebooks don't use Markdown because it's definitely better, but rather because it's different and thus encourages users to think about their work differently. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is very important for computer science students to learn how to conceptualize input and output as dependent, but also distinct. One good reason to use Markdown is that it encourages this kind of thinking. Relatedly, it might also promote focus on substance over surface aesthetic. Markdown is somewhat limited in its style options, which means that there are inherently fewer non-subject-specifc concerns to agonize over while working. It is the conceit of this philosophy that you would, by using Markdown and this Notebook, begin to think of the specific stylistic rendering of your cells as distinct from what you type into those same cells, and thus also think of the content of your writing as necessarily separate from its formating and appearance.

In a hard-wrapped paragraph the line breaks are not dependent on the size of the viewing window. If you click and drag your mouse to expand a word processing document, for example, the shape of the paragraphs and the length of the lines will not change. In other words, the length of a hard-wrapped line is determined either by the number of words in the line (in the case of word processing software where this number is predetermined and the program wraps for the user automatically), or individual intention (when a user manually presses an Enter or Return key to controll exactly how long a line is).\n",

If you increase the size of a window where soft-wrapped paragraphs are displayed, they too will expand into longer lines, becoming shorter and wider to fill the increased window space horizontally. Unsurprising, then, if you *narrow* a window, soft-wrapped lines will shrink and the paragraphs will become longer vertically. \n",
